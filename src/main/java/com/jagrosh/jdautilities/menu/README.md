# Menu Package

Interactive, organized, dynamic menus for your Discord bot.

This framework is great for giving your users a beautiful interactive response
to anything, from paginating items, to labelled options with reaction buttons.

**Note:** This package makes heavy use of `EventWaiter`, which is a part of the
[commons package](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities/tree/master/commons).
